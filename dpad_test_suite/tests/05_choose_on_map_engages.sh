# auto-focused AND the map auto-engaged, so arrows pan immediately to place the pin. The bare-map
# change removed the global auto-engage; this is the pick-mode-scoped restoration. Before the fix,
# pick mode opened with nothing focused, not engaged, and no visible affordance — undrivable.
# Deep + network-bound; self-skips if it can't reach pick mode. docs/dpad.md.
