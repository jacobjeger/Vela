# dpad_test_suite/audit_dynamic.sh — EXHAUSTIVE on-device D-pad auditor.
#
# Drives to every reachable surface and stress-tests three invariants that MUST hold everywhere:
#   (1) opens focused        — a primary element is focused on open (no wasted keypress),
#                              except the bare map, which is ambient (first arrow -> search bar).
#   (2) focus never lost     — pressing DOWN across the whole surface always leaves SOMETHING
#                              focused (a null sample = a dead-end / focus-swallowing trap).
#   (3) no trap              — BACK returns to the previous surface.
# Nothing escapes: any surface that opens unfocused, drops focus mid-traversal, or won't BACK out
# fails the audit. Complements audit_static.sh (which proves every control has a ring/key path).
