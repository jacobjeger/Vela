/**
 * 1-D Kalman filter over the nav puck's along-route SPEED, fusing the ~1 Hz GPS fixes
 * (measurement update) with the accelerometer (prediction step) — the missing piece behind the
 * puck's weird behaviour when slowing or stopping: dead reckoning at the LAST fix's speed keeps
 * gliding at full speed for up to a whole fix interval after you brake, and since the displayed
 * progress is monotonic (never backward, by design — GPS jitter protection) the overshoot can't
 * be walked back; the puck sat metres ahead of a stopping car until the car "caught up" to it.
 *
 * With the accelerometer in the predict step the modelled speed collapses the moment you brake —
 * `v ← v + a·dt` each frame, clamped at 0 — so the puck decelerates WITH the car between fixes
 * (what Google's puck does). No accelerometer (sensor missing / not yet delivering) degrades
 * gracefully: `a = 0` holds the speed constant, which is exactly the old behaviour.
 *
 * Pure math, no Android — unit-tested in `:core`. Units: seconds, m/s, m/s².
