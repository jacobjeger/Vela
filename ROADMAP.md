# Vela Maps - Roadmap

> Where Vela is going. [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) is what's **shipped**;
> [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) is **how it's built**; this file is **what's planned** and the
> bigger bets. Keep it current - add ideas here the moment they come up.

Last updated: 2026-07-08.

## Recently shipped
- **Whole-state offline place packs + self-updating packs (2026-07-07).** Downloading a state pulls a
  CI-baked SQLite of the entire region's OSM POIs/addresses/streets, so offline search works
  Organic-Maps-style anywhere in the state. Packs rebuild monthly from fresh OSM and installed ones
  update in place through small row-level deltas (a Washington test delta was 5.6 KB against the 143 MB
  pack). Offline typed-address geocoding shipped alongside (house-precise, interpolated, street fallback).
- **Android Auto, first cut (2026-07-08).** Vela appears in the car launcher (AA "Unknown sources" for
  sideloads): live map, puck, route, and the current-maneuver card from the same NavSession the phone
  runs. Car-side search/route-start is the follow-up.
- **Open building + house-number overlays (2026-07-04/05).** Microsoft footprints (ODbL) and OpenAddresses
  numbers as per-region PMTiles, streamed over the map by default where OSM is thin, downloadable for
  full offline. Traffic lights + stop signs draw at close zoom (keyless Overpass).
- **In-app updater + content toggles (2026-07-08).** A PipePipe-style updater checks the newest GitHub
  release (about daily, Settings toggle), downloads the APK and hands it to Android's installer. Plus
  Settings switches to hide reviews and skip photo loading, and a 3D-buildings toggle for weaker GPUs.
- **In-process neural voice (Piper) - DONE, device-verified.** Vela bundles the sherpa-onnx VITS
  runtime and downloads a **Piper** voice itself (progress bar), running it in-process as the default nav
  voice - near-Siri quality, no standalone TTS app. Default = **HFC Female** (`en_US-hfc_female-medium`,
  ~67 MB). The old F-Droid voice-engine *installers* were removed; system engines stay selectable for
  override. *(Earlier iterations shipped Kokoro then Matcha; both were removed after on-device A/B - 
  Kokoro was ~0.4× realtime even on a Pixel 9. History in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).)* **Next:**
  validate the arm64 `.so` load on a 16 KB-page GrapheneOS device; revisit on-demand delivery (dynamic
  feature) to shrink the base APK. *(Nav-string localization + per-language voice pairing SHIPPED - see
  the localization entry / `FEATURES.md`.)*
- **Voice browser - DONE 2026-07-03, device-verified.** Settings → Voice → **Voice library** downloads and
  switches between ~40 curated Piper voices (Lessac, HFC Female/Male, Ryan, LibriTTS-R, GB voices, a GLaDOS
  novelty…), each in its own `filesDir/piper/<id>/`; per-voice speaker prefs; race-free switch; in-place
  migration of the old single-voice install. Details in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md). **Next bets:** (1)
  host the catalog (`PiperCatalog`) on the signed `calibration.json` so new voices ship without an APK - 
  would also require **pinning the download host** (`github.com`) in the calibration allowlist so a
  compromised bundle can't redirect a "voice" download at an attacker binary; (2) a preview-without-
  switching ▶ (a second transient `OfflineTts`) so you can audition before committing; (3) a shared
  `espeak-ng-data` dir across voices (~10 MB saved per voice).

## North star

A degoogled, keyless Google-Maps replacement that reaches **parity** with Google
Maps and, over time, **leans less on Google** by growing Vela's own data layer
(starting with traffic). Privacy-first, F-Droid, GPLv3 - every new data flow is
opt-in and documented in [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Recently shipped (2026-06-28 → 30)

The big recent landings - detail in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) / [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md), full
journeys below under Big bets / Known-hard:

- **Open router (OSRM) is now PRIMARY** - complete street-named turn-by-turn incl. **highway `ref`s /
  exit numbers / sign destinations**; Google demoted to the live-traffic overlay + jam-reroute + fallback.
- **Offline routing on-device (GraphHopper)** - a **135-region world catalog** (all US states, Canada,
  Europe, +) built by a race-safe CI matrix, hosted on GitHub, downloaded per region; smallest-covering
  region selection; combined map+routing area download; a location-aware, filterable picker.
- **Navigation** - a **real per-lane diagram** (OSRM lane data), highway/exit shields on the banner,
  OSRM retry (fewer nameless fallbacks), and the traversed-grey trail tightened under the arrow.
- **Nav guidance de-noised (2026-07-01)** - the lane diagram now only shows within ~0.5 mi of the maneuver
  (`LANE_SHOW_M`) and the "then &lt;next&gt;" compound line only when the next maneuver closely follows
  (`COMPOUND_M`, `isCompoundNext`) + carries the next step's shield; both used to render for maneuvers miles
  ahead (reported noise). Also fixed: business name leaking into the place address (`stripNamePrefix`).
- **Alternate-route deltas (2026-07-01)** - the directions picker now shows a **"+N min"** tag on each
  slower alternate (fastest keeps "Fastest"), so the alternates are weighable at a glance (Google-style);
  device-verified on Davis→Sacramento (Fastest via I-80 & US-50, +1 min via I-80 Bus, +13 min via CA-84).
  *Remaining lane idea (future):* highlight the **continuing** lanes for a compound maneuver (which of the
  exit lanes also serve the immediately-following keep/merge) - OSRM gives no cross-step lane linkage, so it
  needs a careful heuristic; deferred rather than fake it.
- **Traffic snap earns its lead** - the option-3 reroute only leads when its live ETA beats OSRM's
  free-flow best (`SNAP_ETA_MARGIN`), so a divergent-but-not-faster snap no longer wins.

*Still to validate on real drives:* route-speed parity vs Google (the snap-guard threshold is tunable
from the `directions` diag), offline highway refs (a graph rebuild - parked).

## Near-term (next up)

- ~~Save my parking spot~~ - **SHIPPED 2026-07-08, device-verified end to end.** Long-press
  the locate button to save the spot (toast confirms); a small "P Parked" chip sits above
  the button while one is set, survives app restarts, taps into WALK directions to a
  "Parked car" destination, and clears with a hold. Follow-up ideas: offer to save
  automatically when a drive ends; distance/age on the chip; a note or photo.

- **Import Google Maps saved lists** (issue #1) - **first cut SHIPPED 2026-07-08,
  device-verified**: paste a share link into the search bar → the list's places land as
  results with the owner's per-place notes shown on each sheet (extraction documented in
  SPEC: share link resolves logged-out, page embeds a complete getlist request, parser
  unit-tested). Remaining: first-class LOCAL lists (create/rename/icon, import INTO a
  list, per-place notes editable) - the full issue #1 ask - plus a share-TO-Vela intent
  so the link never needs copying.

- **D-pad polish** (base support SHIPPED + full-function sweep done 2026-07-07 - see
  `docs/dpad.md`): a real-device pass on D-pad hardware to tune the pan step / OK-hold
  threshold / focus-ring visibility and traversal order; **pixel-verify the full-screen
  reviews WebView's ↑/↓ page-scroll on an unfiltered network** (the handler is wired +
  reach/exit are proven, but the test device's content filter throttles the reviews carve so
  the loaded page never renders there); consider an on-screen key-hint pill while the map
  target is focused.

- ~~Visible-WebView reviews panel~~ - **SHIPPED 2026-07-01 (experimental, default ON,
  Settings toggle)**: Google's live reviews pane embedded in the place sheet's Reviews tab,
  CSS-carved, theme-matched, tracker-blocked, navigation-locked; native scraped list is the
  automatic fallback. (An iframe remains impossible - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`,
  verified - but a WebView isn't an iframe.) Remaining polish ideas: hide the "Get pickup
  or delivery / Order online" promo block inside the panel; make the panel height adaptive
  instead of 560 dp; extend the same treatment to the photo gallery.

- ~~Higher-res README screenshots~~ - **DONE 2026-06-21** (all 9 recaptured at
  1080×2400 on-device, current UI). Store screenshots when there's a store listing.
- **Stability pass** - core flows smoke-tested on-device 2026-06-21 (fresh install →
  search → route → transit → nav, no crashes). Still open: the *Start → launcher* quirk
  (nav keeps running in the foreground service but the activity backgrounds).
- ~~Custom directions origin~~ - **DONE + device-verified 2026-06-20 (in-panel
  editable From).** The directions panel's **From** row is tappable → opens search →
  the pick becomes the origin (`directionsOrigin: Place?`, route falls back to live
  location when null). Chose the in-panel treatment over Google's top-bar From/To.
  **Bug found + fixed on first device test (0.2.132):** the picker overlay was driven
  by `searchFocused` (tied to the text field's focus), but it was opened *without*
  focusing the field - so `clearFocus()` (every close path) was a no-op and the overlay
  got stuck (no feedback on tap, couldn't back out). Now the overlay is driven by
  `searchOpen = searchFocused || pickingOrigin` and pick-mode is reset explicitly.
  Verified: pick reroutes (In-N-Out→Sac = 19 min), back cancels cleanly. A **"Your
  location" reset row** sits at the top of the picker to drop a custom origin back to
  live GPS (added 0.2.133). ~~Follow-up: editable origin while *reversed*~~ - **DONE
  2026-06-20**: the edit pencil moves to the "To" row when reversed (where the custom
  endpoint then sits), via a parallel `onEditDestination` on the directions panel.
- ~~**Real highway shields in the nav banner**~~ - **v1 SHIPPED 2026-06-27.** Interstate
  (red-top/blue) + US-route (white) shield silhouettes drawn as Compose `Canvas` paths, a
  neutral white marker for state/provincial routes, network **inferred from the ref prefix +
  a state/province set** (`parseRouteRef`, unit-tested; `I`→interstate, `US`→US route, a
  2-letter state/province code → state, else the plain bordered chip) - no OSM lookup, as
  agreed. `ROUTE_RE` broadened to capture `XX-NN` state/province refs. **Remaining:**
  per-state/province *shapes* (a California spade vs Ontario's crown) from the **OpenStreetMap
  Americana** set ([ZeLonewolf/openstreetmap-americana](https://github.com/ZeLonewolf/openstreetmap-americana)),
  and broadening the ref capture once the **travel logs** show the real ref formats Google emits.
- **Explore (nearby things to do)** - a Google-Maps-Explore-style surface: nearby
  restaurants / things to do / events, as cards on a bottom sheet from the bare map.
  Data: our keyless POI search already returns categorised places (reuse the
  category chips + `/search?tbm=map`), ranked by distance + rating; "events" is the
  harder, sparser part (no keyless Google events feed - likely OSM/OpenStreetMap +
  a public events source later, or skip v1). **Plan, not now** (per request). Start
  as "Nearby" (categories + top-rated around you); grow toward Explore.
- **Place-page parity gaps** (vs Google Maps; 2026-06-21 audit). The new
  summary-node enrichment (review count / full hours / address / phone / price /
  attributes, backfilled from the focused re-fetch) closed the worst gaps. Remaining,
  by cost:
  - *Cheap - already in the focused node we now fetch, just lift + render:*
    ~~**"People also search for"**~~ - **DONE 2026-06-21** (`root[2][11][0]`, focused
    searches; tappable cards, device-verified). ~~**richer attribute groups**~~ - **DONE
    2026-06-21** (`attributeHighlights` → overview chip row, reuses parsed About).
    ~~**reserve / order / book action links**~~ - **DONE 2026-06-21** (`actionLabel`/`actionUrl`
    at `[1][75][0][0][5]` → prominent button; verified against a "Book online" node + unit-tested;
    a restaurant capture would confirm reserve/order land in the same slot). Remaining: **menu
    link** - probed on-device 2026-07-01 (Olive Garden): **NOT in `[75]`** (that node held only
    "Order online" + "Join waitlist" across 2 groups). The restaurant *does* carry a real menu URL
    (`olivegarden.com/menu/classic-entrees?…`, distinct from the website) **and** menu **photos**
    (googleusercontent `gps-cs-s` images with alt "Food menu (Front side)" / "Drink menu (Back side)"
 - these feed the photo-**categories** Menu tab, DONE). **Menu-link button DEFERRED** - the menu URL
    appears **inconsistently** across Google's responses (found in one capture, absent in the next on the
    same Olive Garden) and its positional path won't pin reliably (fragile calibration). **Lower priority
    now that the menu is accessible via the shipped photo "Menu" category tab** (the actual menu photos).
    A link button would need a stable-path capture first; parked.
    Coverage follow-up: similar-places only rides *focused* searches today - to show it on
    address-snap / list-tap opens too, do a focused name lookup on open (the OkHttp focused
    search carries `[2][11][0]`; the WebView enrichment response does not).
  - **Q&A (questions & answers) - LOGIN-GATED, not keyless (triaged 2026-07-01).** Scraped the logged-out
    `?cid=` page in a real WebView (the tactic that works for reviews/photos) on **both an attraction
    (a landmark) and a business (Home Depot)**: **no Q&A section renders at all** - zero "question" text
    anywhere in the DOM (the only topic-ish chips are review keywords like "helpful employees, mentioned in
    37 reviews"). So Google serves Q&A only to a **logged-in** session - same "needs login" bucket as
    predictive depart-time and the login-gated popular-times path. **Not achievable within the degoogled/
    keyless posture** (no login); the `WebQuestionsFetcher` scaffold was removed. Would only unblock via an
    opt-in Google login, which the project deliberately avoids.
  - *Medium - a separate keyless RPC:* **"mentioned in reviews" topic chips** / review keyword summary
    (these DO render logged-out - the "helpful employees / mask policy, mentioned in N reviews" radios seen
    in the Q&A triage - so this one is feasible: parse those from the reviews page).
    ~~**photo categories** (menu / food / vibe tabs in the gallery)~~ - **DONE 2026-07-01**: the tabs are in
    the `?cid=` page DOM, so `WebPhotoFetcher` visits each category tab + tags photos, and the sheet shows
    All/Menu/Food&drink/Vibe filter chips (`Photo.category`/`Place.photoCategories`). Device-verified.
  - *Photo posted-dates - DEFERRED (triaged 2026-07-01):* gallery TILES (`.aHpZye`) carry only the image
    URL; the date ("Photo - Dec 2022") is only shown for a **focused** photo (lightbox), so per-photo dates
    would need opening each in the lightbox (N interactions). Low yield; `Photo.postedText` + the viewer's
    date caption already exist (unused) for if a per-tile date source ever appears.
  - *App-level:* ~~**multi-stop directions** (waypoints)~~ - **DONE 2026-07-01** (an "Add stop" row in the
    directions panel; routes OSRM straight through the stops via `routeVia` + Google traffic ratio, single
    route; device-verified). ~~Follow-ups: per-stop arrival announcement, reorder, reroute-through-remaining~~
 - **also DONE 2026-07-01**: per-stop "You've reached &lt;stop&gt;" voice cue (`NavEngine.stopMarks`,
    unit-tested), reroute-through-remaining (off-route reroute + faster-recheck now go through unreached
    stops, reaches-dest guards intact), and up/down reorder arrows (`moveStop`).
    **avoid tolls/highways** (a directions-`pb` options field - see Known-hard), **explicit lists/labels** for
    saved places.
  - *Not feasible keyless / out of scope:* Street View (key-gated - see Known-hard),
    satellite imagery (no open keyless source), account features (your contributions,
    timeline, writing reviews - degoogled by design), flights/hotels booking tabs.
  Recommended order: the *cheap* group first (one parser+UI pass, reuses the
  enrichment plumbing), then Q&A, then review-topic chips.
- ~~Traffic browse-overlay - keep, drop, or rebuild?~~ - **RESOLVED 2026-06-19:
  hidden in Settings.** Decision (yours): keep it but **move the toggle off the map
  into Settings → Map** so it doesn't clutter - nav's per-segment route colouring is
  the primary traffic view; the whole-map raster is now an opt-in browse aid in
  Settings, subdued (below POIs, 0.6 opacity). Not dropped entirely (still useful for
  scanning a wider area), not rebuilt (no keyless vector congestion source).

## Big bets

### Buildings  *(done - keyless, no key, no infra)*

Real building footprints render now. They were **already in our tiles** - the
OpenMapTiles `building` + `building-3d` layers (OSM data, much of it imported from
Microsoft's footprints) - Vela just coloured them a hair off the land so they were
~invisible; bumped the contrast + added an outline (2026-06-19). No key, no new
data. The gap-filling actually happened (2026-07-04): **Microsoft footprints (US + Global ML) ship as
per-region PMTiles** (`OverlayTileStore`, CI-baked, 361-row catalog), streamed under the OSM
buildings by default and downloadable for offline - so thin-OSM suburbs render houses now. 3-D massing at high zoom is already on via `building-3d`. **Parcels: not
pursuing** (lot/assessment data - a per-county scraping + backend commitment with
licensing heterogeneity; out of scope by decision 2026-06-19).

### Opt-in telemetry  *(planned - deliberate, careful)*

Goals, **strictly opt-in**, off by default:

1. **Developer diagnostics - ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-19, local-only).** Settings →
   Diagnostics (off by default) keeps an in-memory breadcrumb log (searches, routes,
   parser drift, nav start/reroute/arrival) the user can **Export debug session** and
   hand to a dev via the share sheet. **No backend, no auto-upload** - user-initiated +
   user-routed (`core/diag/DiagLog`, `app/diag/DiagExporter`). The remaining piece here
   is optional: a one-tap upload sink (needs the backend below) instead of manual share.
2. **Trip recording + replay - ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-19, local-only).** Settings → "Save
   my trips" (a **separate, more-invasive** opt-in - it's your exact routes) records
   each navigation's GPS trace to a file (`app/replay/TripStore`); a trip replays on
   the map at 3× (`LocationProvider.replay`) to test turn-by-turn without driving.
   First-run prompt offers it separately from diagnostics. ~~Follow-up: auto-route +
   Stop-replay control~~ - **DONE 2026-06-20**: replay auto-routes to the trip's
   destination and runs real turn-by-turn (torn down when it ends), with a **Stop replay**
   control on the map. Trips also have a **Share** button (FileProvider, like the diag
   export) so a drive can be pulled off a *release* build for debugging - still
   user-initiated, never auto-uploaded. **The navigated route is now saved INTO the
   trip** (`RP`/`RD`/`M` lines, `core/replay/TripLog`), so a replay drives the exact
   blue line the user saw (not a fresh re-route), and the trip can be **audited offline**.
   ✅ **Offline nav auditor - SHIPPED (2026-06-27).** `core/nav/NavReplay` replays a
   trip's GPS fixes back through the real `NavEngine` and **diffs what the cards + voice
   said against where the maneuvers actually are on the route** - per-maneuver: announced
   how far out, turn-now fired?, worst card-distance error, nearest approach; flags
   silent/missed turns, miles-too-early announcements ("exit in 6 mi that didn't exist"),
   and lying card distances. So a shipped travel log can be analysed **without the user
   remembering where it broke** - one call: `TripLog.audit(csv).summary()`, or the
   on-demand test harness `:core:testDebugUnitTest --tests '*auditSharedTripLog'
   -DvelaTrip=<csv>`. Unit-tested end-to-end (clean-drive measurements + the flag logic +
   a full CSV round-trip).
3. **Vela's own traffic data (the long game).** Crowd-source anonymized speed/route
   traces from opted-in users to build a **Vela traffic layer**, blended with Google's
   and eventually replacing it where coverage is good - the first real step off Google.
   The trip recorder above is the on-device half of the trace capture this would need.

**This is a departure from today's "no telemetry, no backend" stance**, so it must be
done so it *earns* trust rather than spends it:
- **Opt-in only**, clear consent screen, easy off + "delete my data," never on by default.
- **Minimize + anonymize**: no account, pseudonymous device token at most; trim precise
  start/end points (snap to road, drop the first/last ~100 m like other traffic apps);
  send speed/heading along road segments, not "user X went from home to work."
- Needs **the first Vela backend** (or a privacy-preserving collector) - pick something
  self-hostable; this becomes a thing to run/secure/subpoena-proof, the opposite of the
  current no-server design, so weigh it.
- **Update [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) in the same change** - it currently (truthfully)
  says "no telemetry"; that line changes the day this ships.
- Could ride the existing **signed channel** for config (endpoint, sample rate, kill-switch).

### Vela traffic layer

Depends on the telemetry above. Aggregate opted-in traces → per-segment speed vs.
free-flow → a traffic overlay + traffic-aware ETAs that don't need Google. Start as a
*supplement* to Google's `/maps/vt` tiles, grow as coverage allows.

## Known-hard / blocked

- **Owner updates / local posts in the place sheet** *(investigated 2026-07-06 against a
  temporarily-closed local Thai restaurant - deferred pending a calibration sample)*. Ground truth from the live probe: a restaurant
  physically closed (paper sign on the door) during its listed hours carried **NO closure signal
  anywhere in Google's data** - no temporarily-closed status, no owner post; even google.com/maps
  showed plain hours ("Closed · Opens 11:30 AM Tue"), and its active "Order pickup online"
  integration keeps the profile looking operational. **No app can be resilient to a paper sign the
  owner never enters into any system.** What we CAN do (and shipped): first-class
  `Place.temporarilyClosed` (multilingual status-text match) → place-sheet banner + hours
  suppression, so when an owner DOES set the formal closure Vela is loud about it. The remaining
  piece - owner POSTS ("closed for renovation until…") - has a discovered keyless-family endpoint,
  **`/maps/preview/localposts?…&pb=…`** (found in the place page's endpoint table next to
  `/maps/preview/place`), but its `pb` grammar needs a live capture from a business that actually
  has owner posts; none found in a bounded hunt (posts are rare + Google demotes temp-closed places
  in search). Revisit when we encounter one - capture the RPC via devtools/Claude-in-Chrome, then
  it's the standard calibration pipeline. The full-screen reviews panel (live Google profile) shows
  Updates already when they exist.

- ~~Busy / popular times~~ - **DONE keyless 2026-06-19** (the 2026-06-18 "login-gated"
  conclusion was *wrong*). The histogram is place node `[84]`; the keyless **OkHttp**
  `/search` is bot-degraded (TLS-fingerprint, like photos/transit) and strips it, which
  fooled me. A real browser engine isn't degraded - **but** there was a second catch
  that nearly fooled me twice: even in the WebView, a **bare-name** search returns a
  20-result `[64]` list that's *also* trimmed of `[84]` (the "Usually"/"No wait" markers
  I first saw were a false positive - review text, not a histogram). The real fix is the
  **query**: a **specific name + address** search (e.g. `In-N-Out Burger 1020 Olive Dr
  Davis CA`) resolves to a *single focused result* whose `[0][1][0][14]` node keeps
  `[84]` (confirmed via live Chrome capture: bare name → 20 results, no histogram;
  name+address → one result with it). `WebPopularTimesFetcher` warms google.com→maps (an
  established NID matters), builds that specific query into both the `pb` and `q=`, then
  same-origin-fetches it; `PopularTimesParser` reads `[84]`. Lesson: when "needs login"
  comes from the OkHttp response only, try a WebView - and check the *query shape* too.
- **Predictive per-departure ETA** - still needs the directions `pb`'s departure-time
  field; re-confirmed unreachable keyless **2026-06-20 (6th attempt, deepest yet)** with a
  real-browser fetch loop + the live web client as oracle. Findings, now thorough enough
  to stop guessing blind:
  - **Read side is dead.** The 810 KB keyless response carries route geometry + the
    current/typical durations but **no embedded time-of-day duration curve** - so the web
    UI is *not* computing future ETAs from pre-shipped data.
  - **Our `pb` template is byte-identical to Google's live web client** (115 tokens,
    diffed against the page's own fired request) - there's no hidden time field we're
    merely omitting; the client sends none for "now".
  - **Direct injection is ignored or 400s.** Re-tested `!8j`/`!8m1`/`!8m3`/`!21m1`
    (accepted but ETA unchanged for a Monday-8am stamp) and `!8m2…`/`!9m2…`/`!7m2…`
    (HTTP 400). Nested-field guessing stays a dead end.
  - **The web "Leave now ▾" control is genuinely un-automatable** - neither CDP-level
    clicks nor keyboard activation open its menu (`aria-expanded` never flips), so even a
    real browser can't be driven to emit a depart-time request. Confirms the old "ignores
    synthetic clicks" note. **Conclusion: predictive per-departure is login/Android-app-
    only**; transit (already fetched via the WebView) is the only keyless mode honouring a
    chosen time.
  - **Shipped instead (2026-06-20): the typical best→worst spread.** Google's own planning
    hint lives at directions `summary[10][4] = [lowSeconds, highSeconds, label]` ("usually
    1 hr 8 min to 1 hr 27 min"); parsed into `Route.typicalRangeSeconds`, shown in the
    depart-time chooser as an honest arrival/leave **window** for a future "Depart at" /
    "Arrive by" plus an always-on "usually X–Y" line. Not per-minute predictive, but real
    keyless data instead of false precision.
  - **Only true-predictive unblock (≈2 min, manual):** capture ONE real request carrying a
    future departure - **mitmproxy on the Android Google Maps app** (set Depart-at, grab
    the `/maps/preview/directions?pb=` GET). Hand me the `pb`; I diff it against
    `DirectionsPb.DEFAULT_TEMPLATE`, find the field, plumb `departureTime` through
    `MapDataSource.directions` + a re-fetch.
- **Avoid tolls/highways** - same family (a directions `pb` options field); deferred.
- **Per-review uploaded photos** - the `listentitiesreviews` RPC (our reviews source)
  returns **only the reviewer's avatar**, never their uploaded photos (verified 2026-06-20
  against Tartine + Bottega Louie: 60 image URLs, all `/a/…ACg8oc` / `/a-/…ALV-`, zero
  `/gps-cs`·`/geougc`·`/p/AF1Qip`). The old parser swept the avatar at `[12][1][3]` into
  the photo strip - now fixed to collect UGC-by-URL-shape only, so it shows nothing here
  rather than a face. SHIPPED since: reviews moved off that RPC entirely to the WebView DOM scrape of the place's
  `?cid=` page (`WebReviewsFetcher`), which carries each review's real uploaded photos - the
  place sheet shows them today. This entry stays only as the record of why the RPC path was dead.
- **Photo contributor name** - the gallery `hspqX` RPC gives each photo's URL + **posted
  date** (`[21][6][8]`, now shown as "Photo · May 2026") + an upload-source tag, but **not
  the contributor's name**: verified 2026-06-20 (every string field on a user photo is the
  url / photo-id / feature-id / source tag - no name anywhere). Google's viewer resolves
  "Photo by Kevin" via a **separate per-contributor profile lookup** keyed by an id we'd
  have to fish out and request per photo - N extra round-trips for a name. Deferred as
  low-value; the date covers the useful half. `Photo(url, postedText)` has room for an
  `author` field if it's ever worth the lookup.
- ~~Per-segment route traffic during nav (Google-parity)~~ - **DONE 2026-06-19.** The
  congestion data was hiding in plain sight in the directions response: `route[3][5][0]`
  is a list of `[level, startMeters, lengthMeters]` spans (only the non-free-flowing
  stretches; gaps are free-flow). `DirectionsParser` reads it into `Route.trafficSpans`;
  `MapScreen` converts metre offsets → fractions; `VelaMapView.routeGradientStops` paints
  the route line per segment over the driven-grey gradient (free-flow blue base, amber =
  level 1, red = level 2, dark red = 3+). Calibrated against Davis→Sac + Berkeley→SF
  (Bay-Bridge approach = one long level-2 span). The whole-map raster stays off during
  nav - the route now carries the traffic, like Google. *(Level→colour mapping is the
  best read of the 1/2 grades seen; trivially flipped if a heavy drive shows otherwise.)*
- **Individual traffic incidents (crashes / construction / closures) - INVESTIGATED 2026-07-01, no clean
  keyless source yet.** Google shows discrete incident icons/cards ("Crash ahead", "Road closed"); Vela
  today has only the aggregate **congestion spans** (`route[3][5]`, per-segment colour). Probed the raw
  keyless `/maps/preview/directions` (OkHttp) on a 25-mi the metro route: **423 KB, zero incident text**
  (no "crash"/"accident"/"construction"/"closure"/"closed" anywhere) and `route[3][5]` empty off-peak - so
  the OkHttp directions payload carries congestion grades but **no per-incident objects/text**. Three
  candidate paths:
  1. **WebView / Google - CHOSEN by the user, then INVESTIGATED (2026-07-01): it bottoms out at binary
     tiles, NOT a clean read.** Unlike photos/transit/popular-times (where the driving/transit page's
     `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE` carried the data OkHttp stripped), the **driving page state has no incidents
     either** - captured it in the anonymous WebView twice (444 KB, then 471 KB), **zero incident text both
     times**. Then intercepted the WebView's network (`shouldInterceptRequest`): the **only** traffic-related
     requests are **`/maps/vt/…` - Google's proprietary binary vector tiles** (`/maps/vt/proto`,
     `/maps/vt/pb=!…!2m2!1e1!…` = the traffic layer). So incidents render from the **`vt` tile stream**, which
     is Google's own obfuscated protobuf (NOT standard MVT - MapLibre can't decode it). Getting incidents this
     way = **fetch the route's `vt` traffic tiles + reverse-engineer their binary schema + track its changes**:
     a large, fragile RE effort, the same "decode Google's `/maps/vt`" lift the route-naming note flags - an
     order of magnitude more than the page-state reads, and it can break whenever Google reshapes the tile.
  2. **Open DOT / 511 incident feeds** - the **degoogled-pure** alternative (open government data, no Google
     scrape): structured incidents w/ lat-lng, category, severity, headline - **already JSON**, no binary RE.
     Fits Vela's ethos better than scraping Google, and **Caltrans/511** publishes a well-documented
     free feed (live-testable). Cost: feeds are **fragmented** (per-state/metro APIs, differing shapes) and
     often **token-gated** (free, but a key → the optional-user-token model we use for `MAPTILER_KEY`, never
     committed). Pluggable provider + start with one region (like the routing catalog grew), grow coverage.
  3. **Defer** - congestion colouring already covers "where's it slow"; discrete incidents are polish.
  **Status: Google path's true cost now known (binary `vt`-tile RE, high + fragile). Given that, the
  open-feed path is likely the pragmatic way to actually ship incidents despite its fragmentation - surfaced
  to the user with the recalibrated tradeoff. All probes removed; nothing half-built shipped.**
- **On-device map-matching (GraphHopper) - the "Google routes, the engine names the turns" unlock.**
  > **✅ SHIPPED as the OFFLINE ROUTER (2026-06-30)** - Phase 1 is done end-to-end + on a 135-region world
  > catalog (see "Recently shipped" up top, `SPEC.md` §Offline routing, `FEATURES.md`). This long entry is
  > the **engineering record of how it was un-blocked**; kept for reference. Still OPEN = **Phase 2**: use the

  *(Engine chosen 2026-06-28: **GraphHopper**, NOT Valhalla - see below. Multi-session.)* Beyond going
  offline, this is what makes **clean always-snap** routing possible: always take Google's traffic-smart
  path and use an on-device engine only to recover street-named turns - *Google picks the road, the open
  engine names it*. **Why we can't do it cleanly on public infra today (measured), and that NO
  self-hosting is required:**
  - Google's keyless **polyline is complete** (decoded `[0][7][i]`), so the path is fully traceable.
  - The clean tool is **map-matching** (trace → roads+turns). FOSSGIS **`/match` caps at 10 coords**
    (`TooBig` past that, ~0.01 confidence that sparse); public **Valhalla `/trace_route` times out**.
  - The serverless fallback, **dense-waypoint `/route`** (40–100 vias, no cap), reproduces Google's
    path *exactly* with 0 U-turn artifacts - **but a via landing on a turn is swallowed into a via
    arrive/depart → ~1-in-10 named turns lost** (measured: dropped "turn right onto Village Green
    Drive"). Turn-loss is the exact bug we just fixed, so always-snapping that way is a regression.
  - **Shipped instead:** option 3 - snap only on real traffic divergence, with modest (12) vias (see
    `SPEC.md` / `FEATURES.md`). Public-server-clean, keeps perfect turns on the free-flow majority.
  - **The unlock = on-device map-matching.** Engine research (2026-06-28) compared GraphHopper / Valhalla
    / BRouter / Mapbox: **GraphHopper wins** - it's **pure JVM (no NDK)**, so it runs on Android with no
    native cross-compile (GrapheneOS-friendly), its **map-matching module is embeddable + Apache-2.0**,
    and it returns street names per edge (`EdgeIteratorState.getName()` / `street_name` path detail).
    Valhalla's Meili is great but **no maintained Android binding exposes map-matching** (Rallista/
    valhalla-mobile is route-only) → would mean owning a C++/JNI Meili surface; BRouter has **no street
    names in its data** and no map-matching; Mapbox is token/MAU-gated. **JVM spike PASSED (2026-06-28):**
    GraphHopper v11, fed a **bare 26-pt downsampled polyline** (no street info, Monaco), recovered **7/7
    ground-truth street names in 34ms** - proving "scraped polyline → complete named turns" with **no
    turn-loss** (names per road-segment, not per via). `/tmp/ghspike` (throwaway).
  - **Sizing - MEASURED 2026-06-28, favourable.** A full metro (Washington DC, 21 MB extract) builds to a
    **15 MB** GraphHopper graph folder (single car profile, flexible/no-CH), import 3.7 s on desktop - 
    *smaller* than the basemap tiles for the same area, and downloads the same way. A whole US state ≈ 10×.
    So "ship/download a routing graph per region" is comfortably in line with the offline-tile download we
    already do. We **import off-device** (CI/desktop) and ship the prebuilt graph; the phone only loads it.
  - **ON-DEVICE: VALIDATED end-to-end 2026-06-28** (`:ghprobe`, throwaway instrumented test, **PASSED on a
    Pixel 5a / Android 14**): GraphHopper v11 **loaded** a prebuilt Monaco graph in **137 ms**, **routed**
    1938 m / 11 instructions, and **map-matched** a bare polyline → **10 street names in 1.37 s**. So
    GraphHopper v11 *does* run on ART - but needs **three workarounds**, each found + fixed live:
    1. **`graph.dataaccess=MMAP`** (via `GraphHopperConfig`, no public DAType setter). The default
       `RAMDataAccess` static-inits a `VarHandle.withInvokeExactBehavior()` (JDK-16) that **ART lacks** →
       `NoSuchMethodError`. `MMapDataAccess` doesn't use it. (RAM_STORE & MMAP share on-disk format, so the
       desktop-built graph loads as MMAP with no rebuild.)
    2. **Dodge Janino.** v11 *mandates* custom-model profiles, compiled to JVM bytecode by Janino → ART
       can't load it (`"Cannot compile expression: can't load this type of class file"`). Fix: subclass
       `GraphHopper`, override the **`protected createWeightingFactory()`** to return a hand-rolled
       `SpeedWeighting` (Janino-free) **plus an access block** (`if !car_access → ∞`, mirroring car.json's
       `multiply_by 0`) - ~12 lines, no fork. (Plain `SpeedWeighting` ignores access → `ConnectionNotFound`.)
    3. **Swallow `close()`** - MMAP unmap goes through `Unsafe.invokeCleaner`, absent on Android. Harmless:
       the app keeps one engine for the process lifetime and never per-route closes.
    Dependency hygiene confirmed: the OSM-**import** deps (`osmosis-osm-binary`, `protobuf-java`,
    `jackson-dataformat-xml`/`woodstox`/StAX, `xmlgraphics-commons`) are **excluded** from the app - we ship
    prebuilt graphs, so they're never on the load/route/match path, and it dexes + runs clean without them.
    **Net: GraphHopper v11 on Android is PROVEN.** The `:ghprobe` module is the reference recipe; delete it
    once the real `:core` integration ports these three workarounds.
  - **Phasing.** **Phase 1 = GraphHopper as the OFFLINE router** (the hybrid the user described:
    online OSRM+option-3+Google-traffic when connected, GraphHopper A→B with named turns when not) - the
    big win (offline nav at all), and most of the value. **Phase 2 (optional) = online clean-turn
    map-matching** - in *downloaded* regions, run GraphHopper match on Google's polyline to replace option
    3's lossy dense-via with no-turn-loss naming (the original always-snap). Both need the same on-device
    runtime, selected by connectivity + graph-presence.
  - **Phase 1a - DONE 2026-06-28: engine integrated + R8-proven.** `core/data/RouteEngine` seam +
    `GraphHopperRouteEngine` (the 3 ART workarounds ported from `:ghprobe`, translates GraphHopper's path
    → Vela `Route`/`Maneuver`, DRIVE/car for now). `graphhopper-map-matching` is a `:core` dep (import-only
    deps excluded); `consumer-rules.pro` keeps graphhopper/hppc/jts/jackson for R8. **`:app:assembleRelease`
    (R8) builds clean**, `:core` unit tests green (`GraphHopperRouterTest` covers the sign/phrase mapping).
    Cost: **APK 45.7 MB (~+10 MB)** - tighter keeps / on-demand (dynamic feature, like the voice engines) is
    a later optimisation.
  - **Phase 1b-i - DONE 2026-06-28: wired into `directions()` + release runtime proven on-device.**
    `RouteEngine` is provided via Hilt (`CoreModule`, pointing at the per-region graph in app-scoped external
    files) and injected into `GoogleMapsDataSource`; `directions()` falls back to it **only when OSRM came
    back empty** (offline / FOSSGIS down) - online behaviour unchanged. On-device proof (release build,
    Pixel 5a): with wifi+data OFF and a real WA graph present, the app **loaded the graph from external
    storage and invoked the engine** (observed: 486 MB resident / climbing CPU during the compute) - so the
    R8 *release* runtime + external-storage load + offline wiring are all confirmed.
  - **Phase 1b PERF - SOLVED 2026-06-29: metro graph + Contraction Hierarchies + internal storage.**
    Two on-device perf traps, both measured + fixed:
    1. **Storage** - a whole-state graph (WA, 250 MB) on **FUSE-mapped external storage** was I/O-bound
       (25.8% CPU). Internal storage (`filesDir`/`cacheDir`) loads fast (a 53 MB metro graph: **168 ms**).
       External was only ever the adb-pushable *test* path; production downloads to internal.
    2. **Routing algorithm** - plain flexible A* with our interpreted `SpeedWeighting` override is fine on
       desktop (102 ms) but **7639 ms on the Pixel 5a** (slow ART + per-edge virtual calls). Fix =
       **Contraction Hierarchies**, prepared on the *same* `SpeedWeighting` (CH bakes the build-time
       weighting, so it must match the engine's query weighting - it does). **On-device CH route: 188 ms**
       for a 21-mi trip with 18 named steps (40× faster; `:ghprobe` `metroGraphRoutesFastFromInternalStorage`).
    Engine + `:ghprobe` + the new `tools/graphbuilder` all build CH on the shared weighting. A metro CH graph
    ≈ 53 MB (~21 MB zipped). **On-device offline routing is now proven FAST + usable.**
  - **`tools/graphbuilder` (DONE)** - standalone JVM tool (not an app dep) that builds a per-region CH graph
    matching the engine's exact config. `./gradlew :tools:graphbuilder:run --args="region.osm.pbf out-dir"`.
  - **Phase 1b-ii - DONE 2026-06-30: per-region download + END-TO-END offline routing, on-device verified.**
    `RoutingGraphStore` (`:app`) fetches a manifest (`{"regions":[{id,name,url,sizeMb}]}` at
    `BuildConfig.ROUTING_MANIFEST_URL`) and downloads + unzips a region's CH graph into internal
    `filesDir/routing-graph` (progress %, atomic swap, marker file). Settings → **Offline routing (beta)**
    lists regions with Download / Installed-delete; `directions()` already falls back to the engine when
    OSRM is empty. **On-device, full flow PASSED** (release build, Pixel 5a): downloaded the 21 MB the metro
    metro graph → went offline → got a complete route, **21.8 mi via the crosstown arterial, named turn-by-turn, ~200 ms,
    correct 28-min ETA**. (Found + fixed a real bug: GraphHopper's `SpeedWeighting` reports time as if
    `car_average_speed` were m/s, so ETAs were 3.6× too fast - engine + `graphbuilder` now override
    `calcEdgeMillis` to `distance_m·3600/kmh`.) Tested via a local manifest host over `adb reverse` +
    a localhost-cleartext `network_security_config` (production traffic stays HTTPS-only).
  - **Multi-region - DONE 2026-06-30.** Install **several** region graphs (download what you travel); the
    engine reads `filesDir/graphs/index.json` (`[{id, bbox:[S,W,N,E]}]`, written by `RoutingGraphStore` on
    install) and routes each trip on the **first installed region whose box covers both endpoints**, with a
    lazily-loaded `GraphHopper` per region. (A GraphHopper graph is monolithic, so a trip must fit inside one
    region - cross-region trips fall to online.) Manifest entries carry a `bbox`; `inBox` selection is
    unit-tested. **Sizing for "cover the world" (measured CH-graph downloads):** metro **≈ 21 MB**, US state
    **≈ 160 MB**, the whole planet as ONE graph ≈ **30 GB+ → infeasible on a phone**. So world coverage =
    the OsmAnd/Google-Offline model: a catalog of state/country graphs, download your slice. *Remaining there:*
    region granularity for big countries (split by state), and cross-region trips (bigger regions or a future
    merged graph). **Re-download of an already-loaded region still needs an app restart** (the engine caches
    the old graph) - fine for the add-regions common case.
  - **Graph HOSTING - LIVE 2026-06-30.** Region CH graphs + `routing-manifest.json` are published as assets on
    the **`routing-graphs` GitHub release** (a fixed-tag *prerelease*, so it never becomes the "Latest" the APK
    tracks). `ROUTING_MANIFEST_URL` defaults to `releases/download/routing-graphs/routing-manifest.json`.
    Seeded with **Washington (147 MB), the metro metro (21 MB), Washington DC (6 MB)**. **Verified end-to-end on
    a Pixel 5a with a production build** (no localhost): fetched the GitHub manifest → downloaded Washington
    (147 MB) from the release → routed a ~22 mi metro trip offline (28 min, named turn-by-turn).
  - **World catalog + parallel build pipeline - DONE 2026-06-30.** The catalog is now a curated
    **`tools/routing-regions.json`** (135 regions: all 50 US states, Canadian provinces + Mexico, ~36 European
    countries, and starter Asia/Oceania/South-/Central-America/Africa; `big:true` flags country-sized graphs),
    grouped so a whole continent builds in one dispatch. The **`routing-graphs` GitHub Action** is now a
    **race-safe matrix**: a `prep` job turns a `group` (or explicit `ids`) into a build matrix, parallel jobs
    each build their region's CH graph + upload only their own `<id>.zip` + a manifest *entry* artifact
    (nothing shared), and one `merge` job folds every entry into `routing-manifest.json` in a single upload
    (replace-by-id, so re-runs update in place and never clobber siblings). Public-repo Actions minutes are
    free, so this scales to the planet without touching a dev machine. `scripts/build-routing-region.sh`
    (now with `MANIFEST_MODE=emit` for the matrix) + `scripts/merge-routing-manifest.sh` are the two halves;
    the script still does all-in-one single-region builds locally. **THE ENTIRE CATALOG IS NOW BUILT +
    HOSTED - 137 regions live** (135 catalog + the metro/DC metros; all 50 US states, 13 Canadian provinces +
    Mexico, 36 European countries incl. Germany/France/UK whole, 10 Asia, Australia/NZ, 9 South America, 7
    Central America, 7 Africa), ~22 GB of CH graphs as release assets. Every region built first try on the
    12 GB-heap runner - no OOMs. *Still open (minor):* the largest single-country graphs are big downloads
    (Germany/France ≈ 1.2 GB) - optionally split giant countries into Geofabrik subregions later; cross-region
    trips (a trip must fit one region's monolithic graph). **Serverless throughout - static release assets, no
    backend.** On-device verified end-to-end on a Pixel 5a: full 135-region picker, name filter, correct
    location-aware ordering.
    - *bbox fix (2026-06-30):* region boxes come from `osmium fileinfo -g header.boxes` (the declared extract
      region), **not** `data.bbox` (raw node extent - outlier nodes blew Oregon's box across WA + CA, so it
      falsely "covered" the metro in the picker). All catalog builds use the corrected script.
    - *border-overlap fix (2026-06-30):* even clean `header.boxes` boxes carry a Geofabrik buffer that spills
      across borders (British Columbia's box dips into the metro), so the picker, the tiles→routing combine, and
      the engine all now pick the **smallest** box covering you (the engine falls through to the next-smallest
      if a graph can't make the trip) instead of the first.
- **Street View** - the Google Maps EMBED API is key-gated, but the CONSUMER pano
  (`…/maps/@?api=1&map_action=pano&viewpoint=<lat>,<lng>`, Google's documented deep link)
  is **keyless - verified in a real desktop browser** 2026-07-06 (snapped to the nearest
  pano, full interactive WebGL, no key wall). **BUT it does NOT render in an Android WebView
  and was reverted.** Investigated on-device end-to-end (Pixel-class, ARM Mali-G715 + the
  **ANGLE** GL driver): tried the panel in a Compose Dialog, a Dialog with forced
  `FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED`, without the `.alpha()` fade, AND hoisted into the main
  hardware-accelerated window - **black pano in all four.** A JS probe proved the WebGL
  context inits (`renderer: Mali-G715`), the onscreen canvas is full-size (1079×2297), the
  URL resolves to a real panoid, and there's no key wall - yet the pano composites to black,
  AND `document.body` came back at only ~182 chars (a **stripped/degraded page**: Google
  appears to serve the Street-View SPA a minimal shell in the WebView, the same TLS/bot
  defense that degrades our OkHttp scrapes - but here the WebView doesn't rescue it the way
  it does for the `?cid=` reviews/photos pages). The keyless static thumbnail
  (`streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/thumbnail?panoid=…`) 403s on a direct fetch (needs
  browser session/referer), so that fallback is also non-trivial. **Options if revisited:**
  (a) an "open externally" pill → `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` the pano URL (reliable + keyless but
  leaves Vela - against the in-app ethos); (b) resolve the panoid + fetch the thumbnail via a
  background WebView with session (uncertain, thumbnail 403 unresolved); (c) open imagery
  (Mapillary/KartaView) with a free token, sparser but truly renders. Option (a) SHIPPED:
  the place sheet has a Street View pill that opens the keyless pano externally. In-app
  panos (b/c) stay parked.
- **Gallery videos** - parked, low value (re-checked 2026-06-19). The full `hspqX`
  gallery for a busy place (In-N-Out, 50 photos) carried **zero video entries** (no
  `googlevideo.com`/`.mp4`/`m3u8`), so videos are rare in the first place; supporting
  them would need finding a separate (likely gated) video source + a player dependency
  (ExoPlayer/media3) + handling expiring stream URLs - high effort for a feature most
  places don't have. Skip unless a specific place with videos motivates it.
- **Roboto font** - no keyless glyph host serves it; Noto Sans stays.

## Resilience (built - extend as needed)

The signed `calibration.json` channel can already hot-push **config, field paths,
user notices, and sandboxed JS parse-logic** with no app update (see SPEC §5). Future
breakages should be fixed there first.
