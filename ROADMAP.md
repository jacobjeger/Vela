# Vela Maps — Roadmap

> Where Vela is going. [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) is what's **shipped**;
> [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) is **how it's built**; this file is **what's planned** and the
> bigger bets. Keep it current — add ideas here the moment they come up.

Last updated: 2026-06-18.

## North star

A degoogled, keyless Google-Maps replacement that reaches **parity** with Google
Maps and, over time, **leans less on Google** by growing Vela's own data layer
(starting with traffic). Privacy-first, F-Droid, GPLv3 — every new data flow is
opt-in and documented in [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Near-term (next up)

- **Higher-res README/store screenshots** refreshed to the current UI.
- **Stability pass** — smoke-test the core flows; fix the *Start → launcher* quirk
  (nav keeps running in the foreground service but the activity backgrounds).
- **Custom directions origin** (route from somewhere other than your location).
  *Recommendation:* make the directions panel's **From** row tappable to open the
  existing search and pick a place as origin (mirrors the To row + the ⇄ swap we
  already have) — coherent with our in-panel model and low-churn. Google instead
  promotes From/To into the **top search bar** during directions; that's more screens
  to rework. **Suggest: in-panel editable From now; revisit the top-bar treatment
  once the rest of the directions UX settles.** State needs a `directionsOrigin: Place?`
  (route falls back to live location when null); the search result tap sets it when
  we're in "pick origin" mode. Needs device iteration on the pick flow.
- **Explore (nearby things to do)** — a Google-Maps-Explore-style surface: nearby
  restaurants / things to do / events, as cards on a bottom sheet from the bare map.
  Data: our keyless POI search already returns categorised places (reuse the
  category chips + `/search?tbm=map`), ranked by distance + rating; "events" is the
  harder, sparser part (no keyless Google events feed — likely OSM/OpenStreetMap +
  a public events source later, or skip v1). **Plan, not now** (per request). Start
  as "Nearby" (categories + top-rated around you); grow toward Explore.
- **Traffic browse-overlay — keep, drop, or rebuild?** (UX call). The whole-map
  raster paints free-flow green everywhere and re-rasterises on zoom (Google's baked
  tiles; we can't strip green). It's now subdued (below POIs, 0.6 opacity) but still
  inherently noisy. Options: (a) keep as a subtle optional toggle [current], (b) drop
  it — nav already shows per-segment route traffic, so browse-traffic may not earn its
  noise, (c) rebuild from a vector congestion source we don't have keylessly. **Leaning
  (b) or (a); needs your call** — see the queued HCI question.

## Big bets

### Buildings  *(done — keyless, no key, no infra)*

Real building footprints render now. They were **already in our tiles** — the
OpenMapTiles `building` + `building-3d` layers (OSM data, much of it imported from
Microsoft's footprints) — Vela just coloured them a hair off the land so they were
~invisible; bumped the contrast + added an outline (2026-06-19). No key, no new
data. If coverage ever needs filling, **Microsoft US Building Footprints** (~130 M,
ODbL, **free + keyless**) and **Overture** buildings are the open sources — but
they're bulk files you'd tile + host yourself (that's infra), so only worth it for
gaps. 3-D massing at high zoom is already on via `building-3d`. **Parcels: not
pursuing** (lot/assessment data — a per-county scraping + backend commitment with
licensing heterogeneity; out of scope by decision 2026-06-19).

### Opt-in telemetry  *(planned — deliberate, careful)*

Goals, **strictly opt-in**, off by default:

1. **Developer diagnostics — ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-19, local-only).** Settings →
   Diagnostics (off by default) keeps an in-memory breadcrumb log (searches, routes,
   parser drift, nav start/reroute/arrival) the user can **Export debug session** and
   hand to a dev via the share sheet. **No backend, no auto-upload** — user-initiated +
   user-routed (`core/diag/DiagLog`, `app/diag/DiagExporter`). The remaining piece here
   is optional: a one-tap upload sink (needs the backend below) instead of manual share.
2. **Trip recording + replay — ✅ SHIPPED (2026-06-19, local-only).** Settings → "Save
   my trips" (a **separate, more-invasive** opt-in — it's your exact routes) records
   each navigation's GPS trace to a file (`app/replay/TripStore`); a trip replays on
   the map at 3× (`LocationProvider.replay`) to test turn-by-turn without driving.
   First-run prompt offers it separately from diagnostics. **Follow-up:** auto-route
   to the trip's destination on replay so turns run without manually starting nav, and
   a Stop-replay control on the map (currently auto-completes).
3. **Vela's own traffic data (the long game).** Crowd-source anonymized speed/route
   traces from opted-in users to build a **Vela traffic layer**, blended with Google's
   and eventually replacing it where coverage is good — the first real step off Google.
   The trip recorder above is the on-device half of the trace capture this would need.

**This is a departure from today's "no telemetry, no backend" stance**, so it must be
done so it *earns* trust rather than spends it:
- **Opt-in only**, clear consent screen, easy off + "delete my data," never on by default.
- **Minimize + anonymize**: no account, pseudonymous device token at most; trim precise
  start/end points (snap to road, drop the first/last ~100 m like other traffic apps);
  send speed/heading along road segments, not "user X went from home to work."
- Needs **the first Vela backend** (or a privacy-preserving collector) — pick something
  self-hostable; this becomes a thing to run/secure/subpoena-proof, the opposite of the
  current no-server design, so weigh it.
- **Update [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) in the same change** — it currently (truthfully)
  says "no telemetry"; that line changes the day this ships.
- Could ride the existing **signed channel** for config (endpoint, sample rate, kill-switch).

### Vela traffic layer

Depends on the telemetry above. Aggregate opted-in traces → per-segment speed vs.
free-flow → a traffic overlay + traffic-aware ETAs that don't need Google. Start as a
*supplement* to Google's `/maps/vt` tiles, grow as coverage allows.

## Known-hard / blocked

- ~~Busy / popular times~~ — **DONE keyless 2026-06-19** (the 2026-06-18 "login-gated"
  conclusion was *wrong*). The histogram is place node `[84]`; the keyless **OkHttp**
  `/search` is bot-degraded (TLS-fingerprint, like photos/transit) and strips it, which
  fooled me. A real browser engine isn't degraded — **but** there was a second catch
  that nearly fooled me twice: even in the WebView, a **bare-name** search returns a
  20-result `[64]` list that's *also* trimmed of `[84]` (the "Usually"/"No wait" markers
  I first saw were a false positive — review text, not a histogram). The real fix is the
  **query**: a **specific name + address** search (e.g. `In-N-Out Burger 1020 Olive Dr
  Davis CA`) resolves to a *single focused result* whose `[0][1][0][14]` node keeps
  `[84]` (confirmed via live Chrome capture: bare name → 20 results, no histogram;
  name+address → one result with it). `WebPopularTimesFetcher` warms google.com→maps (an
  established NID matters), builds that specific query into both the `pb` and `q=`, then
  same-origin-fetches it; `PopularTimesParser` reads `[84]`. Lesson: when "needs login"
  comes from the OkHttp response only, try a WebView — and check the *query shape* too.
- **Predictive depart-time ETA** + **avoid tolls/highways** — need the directions
  `pb`'s departure-time field, and it resists discovery (re-confirmed 2026-06-19, 5th
  attempt). What's known now:
  - The keyless `/maps/preview/directions` endpoint **is traffic-aware for *now*** —
    a live probe gave typical 1408 s vs traffic 1267 s for Davis→Sac — so only the
    *future-departure* field is missing.
  - **It's a nested field, not a top-level append.** Probing 6 candidate top-level
    fields (`!8j`/`!7j`/`!9j`/`!19j`/`!8i`/`!8m2…` with a Monday-rush timestamp) left
    the traffic ETA *unchanged* — they were parsed-and-ignored, so the field lives
    inside a specific sub-message we can't guess blind.
  - The web client **never fires the endpoint on a depart-time change** (embeds the
    route in `APP_INITIALIZATION_STATE`; only `gen_204` telemetry fires), and the
    "Leave now ▾" control ignores synthetic clicks — so Chrome automation can't capture it.
  - **Unblock (≈2 min, manual):** capture ONE real request that carries a future
    departure. Easiest path that still fires the GET is **mitmproxy on the Android
    Google Maps app** (set Depart-at, grab the `/maps/preview/directions?pb=` request),
    or any session where devtools shows that GET. Hand me the `pb`; I diff it against
    `DirectionsPb.DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` to find the field, then plumb `departureTime` through
    `MapDataSource.directions` + a depart-at picker re-fetch.
- ~~Per-segment route traffic during nav (Google-parity)~~ — **DONE 2026-06-19.** The
  congestion data was hiding in plain sight in the directions response: `route[3][5][0]`
  is a list of `[level, startMeters, lengthMeters]` spans (only the non-free-flowing
  stretches; gaps are free-flow). `DirectionsParser` reads it into `Route.trafficSpans`;
  `MapScreen` converts metre offsets → fractions; `VelaMapView.routeGradientStops` paints
  the route line per segment over the driven-grey gradient (free-flow blue base, amber =
  level 1, red = level 2, dark red = 3+). Calibrated against Davis→Sac + Berkeley→SF
  (Bay-Bridge approach = one long level-2 span). The whole-map raster stays off during
  nav — the route now carries the traffic, like Google. *(Level→colour mapping is the
  best read of the 1/2 grades seen; trivially flipped if a heavy drive shows otherwise.)*
- **Offline routing** — a heavy native engine (Valhalla/GraphHopper). Multi-session.
- **Street View** — key-gated on Google; the aligned path is open imagery
  (Mapillary/KartaView) with a free token, which is sparser.
- **Gallery videos** — parked, low value (re-checked 2026-06-19). The full `hspqX`
  gallery for a busy place (In-N-Out, 50 photos) carried **zero video entries** (no
  `googlevideo.com`/`.mp4`/`m3u8`), so videos are rare in the first place; supporting
  them would need finding a separate (likely gated) video source + a player dependency
  (ExoPlayer/media3) + handling expiring stream URLs — high effort for a feature most
  places don't have. Skip unless a specific place with videos motivates it.
- **Roboto font** — no keyless glyph host serves it; Noto Sans stays.

## Resilience (built — extend as needed)

The signed `calibration.json` channel can already hot-push **config, field paths,
user notices, and sandboxed JS parse-logic** with no app update (see SPEC §5). Future
breakages should be fixed there first.
